1. Client --  Us users
2. Server -- Where all the info stays 
3. Browser -- Where the client access the information


So whent the client/end user searches something on the internet we use the browser and what this browser does is, it 
sends a request to the server lets say the client wants to use instagram and searches for instagram, so the browser
requests the instagram server through an api and if the server accepts the client gets to use instagram.
